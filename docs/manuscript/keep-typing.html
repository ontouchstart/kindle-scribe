    Sam's manuscript: keep typing (2026/01/18)
  </title>
  <body>
    Keep typing. If we need a new paragraph, wrap it with <code>&lt;p&gt; ... &lt;p/&gt;</code> tags.
    <p>
      It is not that complicated.

      What is a manuscript? Based on Wikipedia (I am not going to add link here because this page is meant for reading
      off-line on the kindle scribe. If you want to find out more, please take out of your phone, you or your AI agent 
      can do the work easily if you want to), the word is derived from latin, <i>manūscriptum</i>, which is made of
      <i>manus</i> (hand) and <i>scriptum</i> from <i>scribere</i> (to write). So a manuscript is something made by an 
      author "by hand". Nobody should read a manuscript except for the author and their editors.
